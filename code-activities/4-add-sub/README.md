# Code Activity - ADD/SUB

1. Activity 1

Load the registers `RAX`, `RBX`, `RCX`, and `RDX` each with a unique number.
Use `ADD` instructions to add the contents of all four registers and store the result in `R8`.

2. Activity 2

Load the registers `EAX`, `EBX`, and `ECX` each with a unique number.
Use `SUB` instructions to subtract `EBX` and `ECX` from `EAX` (i.e., `EAX - EBX - ECX`).
Store the result in `R8D`.

3. Activity 3

Add two 8-bit values and store the result in an 8-bit variable.

4. Activity 4

The outside temperature was sampled twice during the day.
The first reading was 67 degrees and the second was 87 degrees.
The first reading is stored in `RAX` and the second in `RBX`.
Compute the change in temperature and store the result in `RCX`.

5. Activity 5

Use an `ADD` instruction to set the overflow flag. Use whatever instructions are needed to prepare registers before the `ADD` instruction.
